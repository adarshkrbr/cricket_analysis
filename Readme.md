# Project: House Price Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## **Problem Statement**
The goal of this analysis is to predict house prices and identify factors that significantly influence them. By doing so, businesses in the real estate sector can:
- **Optimize pricing strategies** based on market trends.
- **Maximize profitability** by identifying high-value attributes.
- **Enhance customer satisfaction** by understanding buyer preferences.

## **Dataset**
We will use the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset** from Kaggle.  
Dataset link: [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)  

---

## **Key Attributes in the Dataset**
The dataset includes features like:
- **SalePrice**: The target variable.
- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality.
- **GrLivArea**: Above-grade (ground) living area in square feet.
- **GarageCars**: Number of cars that can fit in the garage.
- **YearBuilt**: Year the house was built.
- Many more (80+ attributes).

## **Hypotheses and Steps to Solve**
Here are **20 hypotheses**, their solution approaches, and potential business impacts:

| **#** | **Hypothesis** | **Steps to Solve** | **Impact** |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| 1 | Larger houses have higher prices. | Explore correlation between `GrLivArea` and `SalePrice`. Use scatter plots and regression. | Helps buyers/sellers gauge price per square foot. |
| 2 | Houses with better overall quality (`OverallQual`) sell for higher prices. | Analyze `OverallQual` and `SalePrice` using boxplots and correlation analysis. | Suggests the ROI of renovations to improve quality. |
| 3 | Newer houses are priced higher. | Investigate `YearBuilt` trends with `SalePrice`. Check decade-wise trends. | Informs pricing strategies based on house age. |
| 4 | Houses with more bedrooms are costlier. | Use `BedroomAbvGr` vs. `SalePrice`. Check linearity and outliers. | Identifies value-added by bedrooms. |
| 5 | Houses with basements (`TotalBsmtSF`) are more valuable. | Examine correlations and partial dependence plots for `TotalBsmtSF`. | Assists in remodeling decisions. |
| 6 | Proximity to amenities (e.g., schools) increases house prices. | Map geospatial data and test correlations with prices. | Determines the value of neighborhood attributes. |
| 7 | Houses with better neighborhood ratings (`Neighborhood`) sell for more. | Compare median `SalePrice` across neighborhoods. | Aids in targeted marketing for high-value areas. |
| 8 | Garages (`GarageCars`) significantly impact house prices. | Analyze the relationship between garage size and prices. | Suggests investment priorities for builders. |
| 9 | Renovated houses (`YearRemodAdd`) have higher prices. | Explore price trends for renovated vs. non-renovated houses. | Evaluates the impact of renovations on prices. |
| 10 | Open layouts (`1stFlrSF`) attract higher prices. | Test the impact of open layouts using scatterplots. | Guides architects in floor plan design. |
| 11 | Pool availability increases house prices. | Compare median prices for houses with and without pools (`PoolArea`). | Quantifies the luxury market appeal. |
| 12 | Lot size (`LotArea`) has diminishing returns on price. | Fit non-linear models to assess the effect of lot size. | Optimizes land usage for developers. |
| 13 | Energy efficiency boosts house prices. | Add proxy attributes like `HeatingQC` or create derived variables. | Highlights eco-friendly market trends. |
| 14 | Market conditions affect pricing trends (temporal analysis). | Analyze `MoSold` and `YrSold` trends. Check seasonal spikes. | Enables timing strategies for sales. |
| 15 | Houses with fireplaces (`Fireplaces`) have higher appeal. | Compare median prices for houses with and without fireplaces. | Provides a feature-value tradeoff for buyers. |
| 16 | Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`, `HalfBath`) affects price. | Test interactions between bathroom count and price. | Identifies premium bathroom configurations. |
| 17 | Central air conditioning (`CentralAir`) increases house value. | Group data by `CentralAir` and analyze price differences. | Aids decisions on installing AC systems. |
| 18 | Landscaping quality impacts prices. | Use `LotFrontage` as a proxy and test correlations. | Guides outdoor feature investments. |
| 19 | Zoning classification (`MSZoning`) affects prices. | Test differences in median prices across zones. | Identifies high-value zoning regions. |
| 20 | Multi-storey houses cost more. | Compare price distributions by `HouseStyle`. | Helps builders target multi-storey constructions. |

## **Steps to Solve the Hypotheses**

1. **Import Libraries**: Use Python libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.  
2. **Load the Dataset**: Download and clean the dataset by handling missing values.  
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - Summarize and visualize each variable.
   - Check for outliers, skewness, and transformations.  
4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - For numerical features: Correlation, scatterplots, regression models.
   - For categorical features: ANOVA, boxplots, and dummy variables.  
5. **Modeling**:
   - Use regression models (linear, decision trees, or ensemble methods) to quantify feature importance.  
6. **Evaluate Business Impact**:
   - Quantify how each hypothesis drives revenue or reduces costs.

## **Impact on Business Metrics**
Each hypothesis provides actionable insights, such as:
- **Maximizing Sale Prices**: By focusing on high-impact features like quality, location, and size.  
- **Reducing Unsold Inventory**: By pricing houses competitively based on temporal and geographical trends.  
- **Improving Customer Experience**: By catering to preferences (e.g., open layouts, proximity to amenities).
